		<h3> Extracting data from Twitter using Python </h3>

		<p>One of the most important steps when we try to answer a Data Science question is to collect the data that we are going to use to make our analysis. Some times there will be a team of data engineers that will give us the data formatted and beautiful, but some other times we need to take it ourselves.</p>
		<p>Twitter is an excellent resource to collect data for two reasons: First, because Twitter has A LOT of data. Every minute the world writes 350.000 new tweets. Second, because it is easy to access this data. Twitter provides us with an API that will make to work for us.</p>

		<h5> The Twitter API </h5>

		<p>The first thing we need to do is to create a Twitter account in case we don’t have one yet. Using this account we will be able to create a Twitter application by navigating to apps.twitter.com and clicking on “Create New App”. This may take a while, since they will ask us how are we going to use their data, and then someone has to validate that we are not going to do anything wrong with it.</p>
		<p>Once we have our App created and validated, we can access the Tokens</p>
